Final project for csec-380 

Authors:

**Description:**

(WIP) Skitter is a platform for RIT users to communicate their thoughts via short skits. A skit is a short
text only message of 140 characters or less. Users will be able to create a custom display name, designate
an email and upload a profile picture via settings. They will also be able to follow/unfollow other users
so that those users messages will appear on their main message feed. Users will be able to add new skits
or delete their own skits either as a new skit, or as a reply to an existing skit. Users will authenticate
to the system using RIT's exposed LDAP server.(WIP)

**Objectives/Goal:** 

You are charged with developing a heavily user-centric web application. This web application will demonstrate 
fluency in complex web application security notions across various platforms. This will be accomplished by 
using multiple different platforms as part of web application designed around the micro-service architecture 
concept. Students will also demonstrate their familiarity with industry accepted development practices by 
using common development techniques as part of the project. 
 
**Deliverables:** 

 * Dockerfiles and associated Docker-compose file 
 * Design Documents 
 * A zip of your repository 
 * A writeup that answers the questions outlined in the project 




**TODO:**
Requirements and instructions for use will go here as the project develops.
